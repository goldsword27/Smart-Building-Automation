# Smart Building Automation System

The main goal of this project is to implement a smart building automation system by setting up the newly acquired building automation system kit for the Technical Sciences Vocational School. Additionally, an Android mobile application is developed to securely control the devices within the system. This application is designed to facilitate everyday life, enhance energy efficiency, maximize comfort, and ensure safety.

The automation system uses **Home Center Lite** as the central controller. Devices paired with the controller can be accessed over the internet, meaning users can control these devices remotely as long as there is an internet connection. **Home Center Lite** uses **Z-Wave communication technology**, which operates on radio frequencies, allowing signals to pass through walls and obstacles for broader coverage. **Z-Wave** also utilizes a **mesh network** structure, enabling devices to communicate with each other, even indirectly. For example, if a device cannot directly reach the controller, it can transmit the signal through other Z-Wave devices. **Z-Wave** uses **AES-128 encryption**, ensuring secure data transmission.

## üìã Features Overview

### Core Features
- **Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Secure login using **JWT-based token authentication**.
  - Passwords are securely stored using **Bcrypt** hashing.
  - **Two user roles**:
    - **Administrator**: Full access including user management, logs, and device control.
    - **User**: Limited access for controlling devices and viewing logs.

- **Device Control**
  - Remotely manage Z-Wave-enabled devices via a mobile app.
  - Real-time device status monitoring and control.

- **Admin Management**
  - Add, delete, and manage user accounts through a dedicated admin panel.
  - Full access to system logs and configurations.

- **Activity Logs**
  - Detailed records of device activities, including user actions and timestamps, ensuring full transparency.

- **Power Consumption Monitoring**
  - Real-time graphical representation of power consumption for all connected devices.
